# Changelog

## 2.0.2

- In the list of search results, the letters **q w e r t y u i o** pick
  entries 1 to 9, like the digits above them, so on a phone you don't
  have to switch the on-screen keyboard to numbers.
- Entries 10 and up are now labelled **a b c d f g h j k l m s v z**,
  skipping letters that have another job on that screen.
- Built from EBaC commit `9215c24`.

## 2.0.1

- Each Home Assistant user now has their own search history, instead of
  one history shared by everyone. It is kept in the app's storage under
  that user's name, the way the Linux version keeps it in each user's
  home folder.
- History saved by 2.0.0, which was shared, is not carried over.

## 2.0.0

- First release of EBaC as a Home Assistant app.
- Opens from the **EBaC** button in the sidebar, for all users.
- Built from EBaC commit `74d9495` ([neilbrookins/ebac](https://github.com/neilbrookins/ebac)).
